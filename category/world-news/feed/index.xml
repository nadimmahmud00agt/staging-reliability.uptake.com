										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Renowned actress Jaya Ahsan penned a heartfelt note today addressing the devastation caused by the Israel-Palestine conflict. She further conveyed a sense of guilt, acknowledging the contrast between her ability to lead a normal life and that of the displaced Palestinians, who must grapple with the uncertainty of survival. Concluding her post, she poses the question of whether it is too much to seek assistance from powerful nations. She wrote, &#8220;I see pictures of Palestine online, in newspapers, and on television screens. Innocent people are enduring bomb attacks, and even hospitals are not spared. A heartbreaking photograph depicted an entire family perishing, leaving only one survivor seated amidst the lifeless bodies.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than 11,000 people have died so far, and that number includes the deaths of over 4,000 children. These images shatter my heart. Despite trying to divert my mind and focus on work—promoting new releases, attending award functions, and preparing for the Goa Film Festival—I can&#8217;t shake off the feeling of guilt. While our lives continue with everyday activities, their existence is marked by the constant threat of death,&#8221; she expressed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">25 years of ‘Hothat Brishti’ celebrated at Channel i’s office She further added, &#8220;This bloodshed needs to stop. Allow the children to play freely in sunlit fields surrounded by palm trees. Let these individuals reclaim their homes in their own country without being displaced.&#8221; She concluded by stating, &#8220;Can&#8217;t the influential nations of the world come together to rescue them? Is it too big an expectation?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The UN human rights chief on Friday urged an investigation into what he called Israel&#8217;s use of &#8220;high-impact explosive weapons&#8221; in Gaza, which he said was causing indiscriminate destruction in the besieged Palestinian enclave. Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said Israel must end its use of such weapons in the densely populated area, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, half of whom have been displaced by fighting in the last month. Turk was not specific about what weapons he was referring to. Asked for comment, the Israeli military said it was making checks and would respond later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Israel&#8217;s air, sea and land bombardment of Gaza, accompanied now by a ground assault deep inside the territory, aims to destroy the militant group Hamas which controls Gaza. Hamas killed 1,400 Israelis in a cross-border Oct. 7 attack, according to Israeli tallies, and the U.N. has said the assault involved war crimes. Israel&#8217;s subsequent bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 10,000 Palestinians according to health authorities in the Palestinian enclave. The extensive Israeli bombardment of Gaza, including the use of high-impact explosive weapons in densely populated areas is clearly having a devastating humanitarian and human rights impact, Turk told a news conference during a visit to Jordan&#8217;s capital Amman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The attacks must be investigated, We have very serious concerns that these amount to disproportionate attacks in breach of international humanitarian law. Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths in Gaza, saying the group uses the population as human shields and hides weapons and equipment around hospitals, which have been hit by bombardments. Any use by Palestinian armed groups of civilians and civilian objects to shield themselves from attack is in contravention of the laws of war, Turk said. &#8220;But such conduct by Palestinian armed groups does not absolve Israel of its obligation to ensure that civilians are spared. Turk also said Israel must take immediate measures to protect Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, where violence is escalating between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers and settlers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turk said at least 176 Palestinians, including 43 children and one woman, had been killed in incidents involving Israeli security forces since the beginning of October. At least eight Palestinians had been killed by Israeli settlers. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas and said it has also been conducting counter-terrorism operations against militants from the group and other Palestinian armed factions in the West Bank. Over the past 18 months, Israeli troops have killed hundreds of Palestinians &#8211; hardened militant fighters, stone-throwing youths and uninvolved civilians &#8211; and made thousands of arrests across the West Bank. In the same period, dozens of Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Oxygen accounts for about 21 percent of Earth&#8217;s air, with the rest of our atmosphere primarily nitrogen. And most living things &#8211; including people, as we well know &#8211; need oxygen to survive. Earth&#8217;s planetary neighbor Venus offers quite a different story. Its thick and noxious atmosphere is dominated by carbon dioxide &#8211; 96.5 percent &#8211; with lesser amounts of nitrogen and trace gases. Oxygen is nearly absent. In fact, with Venus getting far less scientific attention than other planets such as Mars, the direct detection of its oxygen has remained difficult.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using an instrument aboard the SOFIA airborne observatory &#8211; a Boeing 747SP aircraft modified to carry an infrared telescope in a joint project between Nasa and the German Aerospace Center &#8211; scientists have now detected atomic oxygen in a thin layer sandwiched between two other layers of the Venusian atmosphere. They noted that this atomic oxygen, which consists of a single oxygen atom, differs from molecular oxygen, which consists of two oxygen atoms and is breathable. The researchers directly detected oxygen for the first time on the side of Venus facing the sun &#8211; where it actually is produced in the atmosphere &#8211; as well as detecting it on the side facing away from the sun, where it previously was spotted by a ground-based telescope in Hawaii. Venus rotates much more slowly than Earth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Venus atmosphere is very dense. The composition is also very different from Earth,&#8221; said German Aerospace Center physicist Heinz-Wilhelm Hübers, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications. The thick atmosphere on the second planet from the sun traps in heat in a runaway greenhouse effect. Venus is not hospitable, at least for organisms we know from Earth,&#8221; Hübers added.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The oxygen is produced on the planet&#8217;s day side by ultraviolet radiation from the sun that breaks down atmospheric carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide into oxygen atoms and other chemicals, the researchers said. Some of the oxygen is then transported by winds to the Venusian night side. This detection of atomic oxygen on Venus is direct proof for the action of photochemistry &#8211; triggered by solar UV radiation &#8211; and for the transport of its products by the winds of Venus&#8217; atmosphere,&#8221; said astrophysicist and study co-author Helmut Wiesemeyer of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany. On Earth, our life-protecting stratospheric ozone layer represents a well-known example of such photochemistry,&#8221; Wiesemeyer added.</p>
